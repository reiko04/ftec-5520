## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this application you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 6.11.x). This will include `npm`, needed
to install dependencies. In order install these dependencies, you will also need [Python](https://www.python.org) (version 2.7.x) and
[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will also need the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) plugin for Chrome.

### Building

1. Install truffle, and an Ethereum client. If you don't have a test environment, we recommend Ethereum TestRPC
  ```bash
  npm install -g truffle
  npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
  ```
  
2. Run your Ethereum client. For TestRPC:
  ```bash
  testrpc
  ```
Note the mnemonic 12-word phrase printed on startup, you will need it later.

3. Compile and migrate your contracts.
  ```bash
  truffle compile && truffle migrate
  ```
  
### Configuration
1. In order to connect with the Ethereum network, you will need to configure MetaMask
2. Log into the `testrpc` test accounts in MetaMask, using the 12-word phrase printed earlier.
    1. A detailed explaination of how to do this can be found [here](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/truffle-with-metamask#using-the-browser-extension)
        1. Normally, the available test accounts will change whenever you restart `testrpc`.
        2. In order to receive the same test accounts every time you start `testrpc`, start it with a seed like this: `testrpc --seed 0` or `testrpc -m "put your mnemonic phrase here needs twelve words to work with MetaMask"`
3. Point MetaMask to `testrpc` by connecting to the network `localhost:8545` 

## Running

1. Run the Webpack server.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
The app is now served on localhost:8080

2. Making sure you have configured MetaMask, visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

3. Loan and borrow Ether!
